        Arguments:

        mapping (list of lists of integers or 2-d numpy.ndarray):
            If a list of lists, then we assume the outer list iterates over
            various cg indices, and the inner lists describe the indices of
            which atoms contribute to that particular cg site. As this format
            does not make it clear how many total fg sites there are, n_fg_sites
            must be specified. If instead a 2-d numpy.ndarray, then the array is
            assumed to be of shape (num of cg,num of fg), which each element
            describing the coefficient of how the fg site contributes to the cg
            site. In this case n_fg_sites should not be specified.
        n_fg_sites (integer or None):
            Certain mapping descriptions make it ambiguous how many total
            fine-grained sites there are. This variable allows this ambiguity to
            be resolved.
        tags (dictionary or None):
            Passed to Map init.

        Example:
        -------
            [[0,2,3],[4]] with n_fg_sites=6 describes a 6 particle fg system
            and 2 particle cg system (from the length of the outer list).
            cg particle 0 (equally) depends on fg particles 0,2, and 3 as where
            cg particle 1 depends only on fg particle 4.

            The same information is given by the following 2-d matrix:
                [ 1/3 0   1/3 1/3 0   0  ]
                [ 0   0   0   0   1   0  ]
            Note that in the matrix case, we had to specify the normalization of
            the weights directly, as where in the list format it was done
