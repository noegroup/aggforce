"""Test linear optimized force map generated for a water dimer.

We expect that an optimal force map for a configurational map isolating the oxygens will
include contributions from the hydrogens. This test confirms that the linear
force map optimization scheme returns this result.

No bond constraints are present in the reference trajectory.

This result is not a mathematical certainty, but has been empirically true.
