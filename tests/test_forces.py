r"""Tests force aggregation schemes using a chignolin (CLN025) trajectory.

Some of the tests in this module require JAX to be installed. They are marked via pytest
decorators.  

We do not have a ground truth for validating these results. The tests in this
module instead use either previously generated values (e.g., checking the map
matrices themselves), or compare two sets of mapped forces for consistency.

The provided tests are sound when considering integrals over the canonical
distribution characteristic to the provided trajectory.  However, these
comparison are subject to statistical and numerical noise, and so are compared
up to numerical thresholds. These thresholds have been decided by existing
results and visual inspection, and are not rigorous in any sense. They only
serve as sanity checks for force generation methods, and should not be regarded
as proof that a force aggregation method is correct.

Additionally, note that the provided trajectory data is not close to converged,
which may lead to additional bias.

In practice, the tests seem to be able to detect if molecular constraints are not
obeyed, but cannot detect if a wrong temperature is specified for featurized
maps.

To adapt these tests to other molecules or sources of data, modify get_data.

The tests in this section make references to coarse-graining (CG) terminology
and ideas. For an introduction see the following publications:

    A tuple of the following:
        coordinates array
            array of positions as a function of time (shape should be
            (n_frames,n_sites,n_dims)). Should correspond to the same frames

        forces array
            array of forces as a function of time (shape should be
            (n_frames,n_sites,n_dims)). Should correspond to the same frames

        mdtraj.Trajectory
            mdtraj trajectory corresponding to the sites in the coordinates and

    r"""Check if CLN025 basic and optimized forces consistent via projections.

    Checks to see if the force projections along a random generated set of
    basis vectors approximately matches between a basic aggregating force map vs
    a configuration-independent optimized force map.

    This test has typically been sensitive enough to detect if molecular
    constraints are misapplied in either force map.

    This test is based on the following relationship:
        \int F(x) \dot G \circ M (x) = H
    where F(x) is the force map being applied to configuration x, G is a
    function of CG (mapped) coordinates, M is the configurational CG map, and
    the integral is performed over the fine-grained configurational ensemble. G
    is a function that has the same shaped output as the force map, and \dot
    multiplies all values of F and G element-wise ans sums them at each
    configuration.

    Critically, H is fixed for all "correct" F (F with the same conditional
    mean). This implies that two force maps which both are noisy versions of the
    same manybody-PMF will have the same H (in the infinite sample limit).

    We use this relationship by applying the same formula to a finite trajectory
    chunk. Multiple G are used: each is the force output of a randomly CG
    potential that applies a single fixed Gaussian to every member of a
    per-frame distance matrix.

    The coefficients do not match perfectly; we attribute this to using a finite
    trajectory. This test characterizes the statistical properties of the
    two projections to see if they are just noisy versions of each other (we
    test the correlation and the average difference in the projections).

    This test requires JAX since our strategy for G uses JAX's
    autodifferentiation.

    r"""Test if optimized and basic forces have similar residual differences.

    Checks to see if the difference in force residual between two force-fields is the
    same for a force map based on simple aggregation and that created using
    configuration-independent optimized force.

    This is based on the following property. The configurational integral form
    of the force residual (here denoted R) evaluated for force-field G has a
    noise term and a noiseless term as so:
        R[G] = Noise + R_noiseless[G]
    The noise term does not depend on G. As a result, if you take the difference
    between R for two force-fields they cancel out:
        R[G_0] - R[G_1] = R_noiseless[G_0] - R_noiseless[G_1]
    Critically, the choice of force-map only affects the Noise term. In other
    words, if we take the difference in two force residuals, the noise does not
    matter.

    Note that this logic is developed using the force-residual created from a
    configurational integral (i.e., in the infinite sampling limit). The
    properties found on finite trajectories may differ.

    We use this relationship by applying the same formula to a finite trajectory
    chunk. Multiple G are used:the force output of a randomly CG
    potential that applies a single Gaussian to every member of a per-frame
    distance matrix is compared to a constant force-field that has 0 force
    everywhere.

    The coefficients do not match perfectly; we attribute this to using a finite
    trajectory. This test characterizes the statistical properties of the
    calculated offsets to see if they are just noisy versions of each other (we
    test the correlation and the average difference in the projections).

    This test requires JAX since our strategy for G uses JAX's
